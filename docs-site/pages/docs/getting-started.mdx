## Installation

<Step number={1} title="Install the CLI">

Install the FARM CLI using your preferred package manager:

<CodeTabs
  examples={[
    {
      language: "bash",
      label: "npm",
      code: `npm install -g @farm/cli`,
    },
    {
      language: "bash",
      label: "pnpm",
      code: `pnpm add -g @farm/cli`,
    },
    {
      language: "bash",
      label: "yarn",
      code: `yarn global add @farm/cli`,
    },
  ]}
/>

</Step>

<Step number={2} title="Create Your First Project">

Create a new FARM project with our interactive CLI:

```bash
farm create my-farm-app
```

You'll be prompted to choose your project template:

- **Starter** - Basic FARM setup with authentication
- **AI-Powered** - Includes Ollama integration and ML pipelines
- **Enterprise** - Full-featured with advanced security and monitoring

</Step>

<Step number={3} title="Navigate and Install Dependencies">

```bash
cd my-farm-app
npm install
```

</Step>

<Step number={4} title="Start Development">

Launch both frontend and backend in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts:

- **Frontend** at `http://localhost:3000` (React + Vite)
- **Backend** at `http://localhost:8000` (FastAPI)
- **API Docs** at `http://localhost:8000/docs` (Swagger UI)

</Step>

## Project Structure

Your new FARM project follows a monorepo structure:

```
my-farm-app/
├── frontend/          # React TypeScript app
│   ├── src/
│   ├── public/
│   └── package.json
├── backend/           # FastAPI Python app
│   ├── app/
│   ├── requirements.txt
│   └── main.py
├── shared/            # Shared types and utilities
├── farm.config.ts     # FARM configuration
└── package.json       # Root package.json
```
