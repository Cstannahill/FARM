# Getting Started

The FARM Stack Framework combines FastAPI, AI tooling, React and MongoDB into a unified full-stack platform.

## Installation

FARM is distributed via npm and pip. Install the CLI:

```bash
npm install -g farm-cli
```

Create a new project:

```bash
farm create my-app
```

This scaffolds a React frontend and FastAPI backend with optional AI features.
